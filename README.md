# Power-Bi

#Introduction
The world has become more data driven. It can be daunting to understand or interprete data to draw meaningful decisions if you don't have the relevent data analytical skills and tools. Even for those individuals who do understand the data, it can be challenging to display it in an easily understood format. 
Power BI takes intimidation and hassle out of data analysis and visualization. By connecting to one or more of the hundreds of existing data sources through a secure and simple interface, you can quickly and interact with and understand your data to influence all business systems.

#Using Power BI to build data-driven analytics
Microsoft Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. 
Power BI consists of a Microsoft Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop, an online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service, and mobile Power BI apps that are available on phones and tablets.

#Explore the different Power BI elements
To create Power BI Solutions, there are several major building blocks. These elements help not only what data is being presented, but also how it appears to those users who are consuming it. Those elements are datasets, reports, and dashboards. All elements are organized into workspaces, and they're created on capacities.

Letâ€™s look at each of these elements in more detail.

#### Capacities
Capacities are a core Power BI concept representing a set of resources used to host and deliver your Power BI content. Capacities are either shared or dedicated. A shared capacity is shared with other Microsoft customers, while a dedicated capacity is fully committed to a single customer. Dedicated capacities require a subscription. By default, workspaces are created on a shared capacity. 

#### Workspaces
Workspaces are containers for dashboards, reports, datasets, and dataflows in Power BI. There are two types of workspaces: My workspace and workspaces.

1. **My workspace** is the personal workspace for any Power BI customer to work with your own content. Only you have access to your My workspace. You can share dashboards and reports from your My Workspace. If you want to collaborate on dashboards and reports or create an app, then you want to work in a workspace.
2. **Workspaces** are used to collaborate and share content with colleagues. You can add colleagues to your workspaces and collaborate on dashboards, reports, and datasets. With one exception, all workspace members need Power BI Pro licenses.
